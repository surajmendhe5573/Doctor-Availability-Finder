# Doctor Availability Finder API

The Doctor Availability Finder API provides the availability of a doctor on a specified date and time. The API will accept two inputs, the date and time, and return whether the doctor is available or not. If the doctor is not available on the specified date and time, the API will return the nearest available date and time.
